# Booklib API Works
The Booklib API is a backend service for managing audio books. It is built using the Flask framework and offers a set of RESTful endpoints for managing books, authors, categories, and users. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key components:

## Flask Application Factory:
* The create_app function sets up and configures the Flask application. This approach is known as the application factory pattern, which allows for easier testing and configuration.

## Environment Configuration:
* The application loads environment variables using dotenv, which allows configuration values to be set outside of the codebase.

## Database:
* SQLAlchemy is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to interact with the database.
* Flask-Migrate is integrated for handling database migrations.

## JWT Authentication:
* The application uses Flask-JWT-Extended for handling JWT authentication, including token creation, validation, and revocation.
* Custom JWT callback functions are defined for various scenarios like token expiration, invalid tokens, and token revocation.

## Blueprints:
* The application is modularized using Flask blueprints. Each resource (books, authors, categories, users) has its own blueprint, which is registered with the main API object.
* This modular approach helps in organizing the codebase and making it more maintainable.

## Summary
The Booklib API is structured to be modular and maintainable, leveraging Flask blueprints, SQLAlchemy for ORM, Flask-Migrate for migrations, and Flask-JWT-Extended for authentication. By following the steps outlined above, you can add new endpoints that interact with the database seamlessly, ensuring the application remains organized and scalable.
